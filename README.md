# Frontend URL shortener

## Description

This is a simple URL shortener application. Created for a frontendmentor.io challenge where the assets are provided but you are allowed to implement the design in any way you wish. For this challenge I chose the technologies listed below. The file structure is inspired by Atomic Design but it does not implement every possible tier in the specification due to project size.

## Technologies

- React
- Tailwind
- HTML

## Installation

Enter your project directory

`cd project-directory`

Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/peterphan20/frontend-url-shortener.git`

Move into the created directory

`cd frontend-url-shortener`

Install dependencies

`npm install`

## Usage

The user can take any URL and shorten it to a more manageable URL. If the user clicks on the shorten link it will redirect them to the original site.
